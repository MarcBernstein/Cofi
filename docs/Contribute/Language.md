# Translation Guide

Thank you for your interest in translating Cofi! I appreciate your help in making our app accessible to a wider audience.

## Weblate

I have chosen to use [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/cofi/) as a platform for translations. Weblate provides an easy-to-use web-based interface that allows translators to collaborate and work on translations in real-time.

To get started with translating the app on Weblate, simply visit the [translation page](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/cofi/) and select your preferred language. You can then start translating the app directly on the platform.

There are two Components there [App](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/cofi/app/) and [Fastlane](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/cofi/fastlane/).

[Fastlane](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/cofi/fastlane/) is a collection of app stores metadata that is used to ship the app to F-Droid and Google Play Store

[App](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/cofi/app/) contains all strings used inside the app.

## XML

However, if you prefer to work on the XML files directly, you are welcome to do so. Simply fork our repository, make your changes to the XML files, and submit a pull request. I appreciate any and all contributions to our project!

Thank you again for your help in translating my app! I couldn't do it without the support of our amazing community.
